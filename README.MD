# Automatice Brain Tumour Segmentation using Deep Learning

In this project, Brain MRIs are segmented using Deep learning model using 3D U-net Model. you will find every detail notebook inside repository. In addtion, You can find Testing data as well as different trained model.

## Installation and environemnt setup 

* Clone this repository 
```
git clone git@github.com:pvsnp9/automatic-brain-tumour-segmentation.git
```
 * Create environment with pip3 or conda
 ```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
 ```

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
inside the environment that you have


### Using Notebooks

Here are couples of notebook, but Brain_tumor_auto_segmentation.ipynb is combined of all major notebooks
Go into that notebook, detail instructions are mentioned there.
